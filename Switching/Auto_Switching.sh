# Set the port where your device is connected to e.g. ttyUSB0 or ttyS0
# on WSL the Windows COM3 port is the WSL ttyS3 port etc.
SERIAL_PORT="/dev/ttyUSB0"

# The Baudrate must fit to the MUX setting, mostly it's 115200!
BAUDRATE="115200"

# Set the delay between the commands; Possible with seconds (s) or miliseconds (0.1s) etc.
DELAY="1s"

# Commands with HEX values:
PORT_1='"\x31\x21"'     # = 1!
PORT_2='"\x32\x21"'     # = 2!
